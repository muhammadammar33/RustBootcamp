Now, write me a software development plan for this project. Please mainly focus on the smart contract functions, variables, features to be developed. Then, mention the front-end development as well. It should have less than 6 steps in total. Final step can be deployment.
1. Define Smart Contract Functions and Variables:
   - Identify the essential functions and variables required for inventory management, such as adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as retrieving inventory data.
   - Define data structures to represent products and inventory, considering attributes like name, description, price, and quantity.

2. Implement Smart Contract Features:
   - Develop smart contract functions to enable adding, editing, and deleting products from the inventory.
   - Implement functions to retrieve inventory data, such as listing all products or querying specific products by name or ID.
   - Ensure error handling mechanisms are in place to handle invalid inputs and other potential errors.

3. Design Front-End Interface:
   - Create a user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the smart contract functions.
   - Design screens for adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as viewing inventory reports.
   - Ensure the interface is intuitive and responsive, catering to the needs of store managers and users.

4. Develop Front-End Features:
   - Implement functionality to call smart contract functions from the front-end interface.
   - Integrate user input validation and error handling to provide a seamless user experience.
   - Include features for generating inventory reports and displaying inventory data in a clear and organized manner.

5. Test and Debug:
   - Conduct thorough testing of both the smart contract functions and the front-end interface.
   - Test various scenarios, including adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as handling edge cases and errors.
   - Debug any issues identified during testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.

6. Deployment:
   - Deploy the smart contract to the chosen blockchain network, ensuring proper configuration and security measures are in place.
   - Deploy the front-end application to a web server or hosting platform, making it accessible to store managers and users.
   - Conduct final checks to verify the deployment is successful and the system is functioning as expected in the production environment.
